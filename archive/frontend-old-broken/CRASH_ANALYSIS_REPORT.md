# Frontend Crash Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The browser crashes (Error Code 5) are primarily caused by issues in the logging infrastructure and middleware configuration. The application has been simplified to a minimal dashboard page, but underlying issues remain in the codebase.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Logfire Configuration Issues**
- **Location**: `/src/lib/logfire.tsx`
- **Problem**: The logfire library is attempting to access browser-specific APIs (`navigator`) in the Edge Runtime (middleware)
- **Evidence**: 
  ```
  Error [ReferenceError]: navigator is not defined
  at [project]/src/lib/logfire.tsx [middleware-edge]
  ```
- **Impact**: Middleware crashes on every request, causing instability

### 2. **Dynamic Import Issues**
- **Location**: `/src/lib/dynamic-imports.ts`
- **Problem**: Attempting to prefetch a non-existent component `PatientTable` (should be `PatientDataTable`)
- **Evidence**: Line 114: `prefetchComponent('PatientTable')`
- **Impact**: Runtime errors when idle callback executes

### 3. **Multiple Lockfile Warning**
- **Problem**: Two package-lock.json files exist:
  - `/Users/dionedge/devqai/package-lock.json`
  - `/Users/dionedge/devqai/pfinni/patient-dashboard/frontend/package-lock.json`
- **Impact**: Potential dependency version conflicts

### 4. **Build Manifest Errors**
- **Evidence**: Multiple ENOENT errors for missing build manifest files
- **Impact**: Next.js build process is incomplete or corrupted

## Working vs Non-Working Components

### Working:
- Minimal dashboard page (`/dashboard`) - simplified version with static data
- Basic routing and middleware (with errors)
- Static UI components
- Edge logger (simple console-based logging)

### Not Working:
- Logfire integration in middleware
- Dynamic component prefetching
- Complex dashboard with live data
- WebSocket connections (not tested but likely affected)
- AI and alert components (not fully tested)

## Circular Dependencies

No direct circular dependencies were found, but there are complex dependency chains:
- Components → Stores → Logfire → Browser APIs
- Middleware → Logfire → Browser APIs (causing crashes)

## Memory Leaks and Performance Issues

### Potential Memory Leaks:
1. **WebSocket connections** - No evidence of cleanup in error scenarios
2. **Event listeners** in logfire.tsx:
   - History pushState override (line 232)
   - Window error listeners (lines 238, 247)
   - No cleanup on unmount

### Performance Concerns:
1. **Heavy initial bundle**:
   - React 19.1.0 (experimental)
   - Recharts library
   - Multiple UI libraries
   - Logfire browser SDK

2. **Inefficient dynamic imports**:
   - Attempting to prefetch non-existent components
   - No error handling for failed imports

## Dependency Analysis

### High-Risk Dependencies:
1. **React 19.1.0** - Using an experimental version
2. **Next.js 15.4.5** - Very recent version, potential instability
3. **@pydantic/logfire-browser** - Incompatible with Edge Runtime
4. **Turbopack** - Experimental bundler with webpack config warnings

### Version Conflicts:
- Multiple React-related packages with version 19.x (experimental)
- Testing libraries may not be fully compatible with React 19

## Current Implementation Structure

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Fix Logfire in Middleware**:
   - Remove logfire imports from middleware.ts
   - Use edge-logger exclusively in middleware
   - Move logfire initialization to client-side only

2. **Fix Dynamic Import Names**:
   - Change `PatientTable` to `PatientDataTable`
   - Add error handling for prefetch failures

3. **Clean Up Dependencies**:
   - Remove duplicate package-lock.json
   - Downgrade to stable React version (18.x)
   - Consider removing Turbopack for now

### Medium-term Improvements:
1. Add proper error boundaries
2. Implement memory leak prevention
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Create integration tests

### Long-term Strategy:
1. Gradually re-enable complex features
2. Implement proper logging strategy
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Monitor performance metrics

## Conclusion

The crashes are primarily caused by incompatible libraries in the Edge Runtime and configuration issues. The minimal dashboard works because it avoids these problematic areas. A systematic approach to fixing these issues, starting with the middleware and logging system, should resolve the browser crashes.
