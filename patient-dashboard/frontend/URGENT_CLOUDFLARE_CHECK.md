# URGENT: Check Cloudflare Dashboard

The wrong key (`<YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>`) is STILL being used even after:
1. Deleting GitHub secret ✓
2. Renaming .env.pfinni-demo ✓
3. Forcing correct values in deployment ✓

## THIS MUST BE IN CLOUDFLARE:

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Find your Worker: **pfinni-dashboard-demo**
3. Go to **Settings** → **Variables**
4. Look for: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
5. **DELETE IT or UPDATE IT** to: `pk_test_Y2xlYW4tc3RhbmctMTQtNTEuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA`

## Why this is happening:
- Cloudflare dashboard environment variables OVERRIDE everything
- They persist between deployments
- They take precedence over wrangler.toml and --var flags

The deployment is using the correct key in our config but Cloudflare is overriding it!
