# Current Deployment Issue

## Summary
After 3 days of attempts, the PFINNI dashboard deployment to Cloudflare at https://devq.ai/pfinni is still not working.

## Current Status
1. ✅ Static assets loading correctly
2. ✅ Clerk JS loading from correct domain (lenient-stork-45.clerk.accounts.dev)
3. ✅ Deployment successful to Cloudflare Workers
4. ❌ All pages return 404 (including /pfinni/sign-in)
5. ❌ Middleware redirects to /sign-in instead of /pfinni/sign-in

## Root Cause
OpenNext.js Cloudflare adapter is not handling the basePath (/pfinni) correctly for routing. Despite:
- `basePath: '/pfinni'` in next.config.mjs
- `__NEXT_BASE_PATH__: "/pfinni"` in worker initialization
- Routes manifest showing basePath

The worker is not matching any routes under /pfinni/*.

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Fixed static asset serving ([assets] instead of [site])
2. ✅ Fixed Clerk domain (using valid test instance)
3. ✅ Added all necessary environment variables
4. ❌ Middleware custom redirect (still overridden by Clerk)
5. ❌ Direct page access (/pfinni/sign-in returns 404)

## Options Moving Forward

### Option 1: Remove basePath
Deploy directly to devq.ai without /pfinni prefix. This requires:
- Remove basePath from next.config.mjs
- Update all internal links
- Deploy to root domain

### Option 2: Debug OpenNext
The OpenNext Cloudflare adapter may have a bug with basePath routing. Need to:
- Check OpenNext GitHub issues
- Test with minimal reproduction
- File bug report if confirmed

### Option 3: Use Different Deployment Method
- Vercel (native Next.js support)
- Traditional Node.js server
- Static export if possible

## Immediate Workaround
For testing, could deploy without basePath to a subdomain like pfinni.devq.ai instead of devq.ai/pfinni.
