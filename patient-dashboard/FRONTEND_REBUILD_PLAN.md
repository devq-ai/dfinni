# Frontend Rebuild Plan: PFINNI Patient Dashboard

Based on the analysis of the current codebase and the Kiranism template requirements, this document outlines a comprehensive plan to rebuild the frontend from scratch.

## Overview

The current frontend implementation has caching issues and inconsistent template integration. This plan provides a structured approach to rebuild the frontend using the Kiranism Next.js Dashboard Starter template as a foundation, while maintaining all healthcare-specific requirements.

## Phase 1: Clean Slate Preparation

### Tasks:

1. **Backup Current Implementation**
   - Create backup of current frontend folder
   - Document any custom business logic to preserve
   - Export any custom components worth keeping

2. **Remove Current Frontend**
   - Delete all files in frontend directory except:
     - Backend integration configurations
     - Environment variables
     - Any custom healthcare-specific logic

3. **Initialize Fresh Next.js Project**
   - Use latest Next.js 15 with App Router
   - Configure TypeScript with strict mode
   - Set up Tailwind CSS v4
   - Install shadcn/ui with New York style

4. **Testing and Logging Framework Assessment**
   - Assess current testing coverage and framework
   - Implement Logfire for frontend logging (preference)
   - Evaluate Jest vs Vitest for frontend testing (PyTest equivalent)
   - Set up testing infrastructure to achieve 90% coverage requirement

### Phase Completion Criteria:
- All functions/methods have Logfire logging enabled
- Testing framework configured and base tests written
- 90% test coverage achieved
- All subtasks marked complete in tracking system

## Phase 2: Kiranism Template Integration

### Tasks:

1. **Core Template Setup**
   - Clone Kiranism template structure
   - Adapt authentication to use BetterAuth (API key in ~/.pfinni/.env)
   - Set up directory structure:
     ```
     frontend/
