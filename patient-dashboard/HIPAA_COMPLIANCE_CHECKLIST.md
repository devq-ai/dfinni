## üìä Compliance Metrics

### Current Status
- Administrative Safeguards: 60% Complete
- Physical Safeguards: 25% Complete  
- Technical Safeguards: 95% Complete
- Organizational Requirements: 40% Complete

### Priority Actions
1. Complete risk assessment
2. Develop training program
3. Create incident response plan
4. Establish BAA procedures
5. Document physical security measures

## üö® Immediate Requirements

## üìù Notes

1. **Encryption Keys**: Currently using PFINNI_ENCRYPTION_KEY from environment. In production, implement proper key rotation and management.

2. **Audit Retention**: Logs are sent to Logfire. Ensure Logfire retention policy is set to 7 years for HIPAA compliance.

3. **Physical Security**: While technical controls are strong, physical security documentation needs attention.

4. **Training**: Technical controls cannot replace proper workforce training. Develop comprehensive HIPAA training program.

5. **Incident Response**: Create and test incident response procedures, including breach notification workflows.
