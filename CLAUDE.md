## Security Rules
- NEVER include actual secret values in any output
- NEVER hardcode secrets in code
- Always refer to secrets generically when discussing security issues
- Only use placeholders like <your-secret-key> in examples

These are critical rules that must ALWAYS be followed without exception.
