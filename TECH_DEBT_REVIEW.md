# Patient Dashboard Tech Debt Review

**Date:** January 3, 2025  
**Status:** Both frontend (3000) and backend (8001) services are running  
**Updated:** Incorporating Final Production Proposal requirements

## üö® Critical Issues (P0)

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Remove sensitive credentials from .env file** - Exposed API keys, passwords, tokens
- [ ] **Single .env file location** - Must be at `/Users/dionedge/devqai/.env` only

## üöÄ Production-Ready Action Plan (Per Proposal)

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Testing (4 Hours)
1. **Implement Playwright E2E tests** for authentication
2. **Add Logfire to all critical operations**
3. **Enhance Clerk JWT validation**
4. **Implement audit logging for all data access**
5. **Single .env file at** `/Users/dionedge/devqai/.env`

### Phase 2: Performance & Monitoring (4 Hours)
1. **Optimize database queries with indexes**
2. **Implement response caching**
3. **Add comprehensive Logfire metrics**
4. **Set up alerting rules**

### Phase 3: DevOps & Deployment (4 Hours)
1. **Create production Dockerfiles**
2. **Set up CI/CD pipelines**
3. **Implement Cloudflare deployment**
4. **Create deployment documentation**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (4 Hours)
1. **Implement visual regression testing**
2. **Add advanced security features**
3. **Optimize frontend performance**
4. **Complete HIPAA compliance checklist**

## üí° Immediate Actions
1. **Fix .env location** - Move to `/Users/dionedge/devqai/.env`
2. **Remove all .env variations** - No .env.local, etc.
3. **Rotate exposed credentials immediately**
4. **Implement Playwright tests** - Frontend has ZERO tests
5. **Add Logfire to all backend tests**

## üìù Key Insights from Production Proposal
- **Testing Gap**: Frontend has NO tests - Playwright implementation critical
- **Backend Tests**: Exist but need Logfire integration throughout
- **Production Dockerfiles**: Missing from backend/frontend directories
- **CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions workflows present
- **Security**: Clerk integration exists but needs hardening
- **Monitoring**: Logfire configured but needs enhancement
- **Single .env Rule**: Must use only `/Users/dionedge/devqai/.env`
- **Database**: SurrealDB primary, SQLite when specified
- **Theme**: Dark mode (#0f0f0f, #141414, #3e3e3e) implemented
