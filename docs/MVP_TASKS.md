| Backend API | localhost | 8001 | `uvicorn app.main:app` | ✅ Running | Authentication working, Logfire configured, AI Chat ready |
| Frontend | localhost | 3000 | `npm run dev` | ✅ Running | Next.js frontend with shadcn/ui and cyber theme |
| Logfire | logfire-us.pydantic.dev | N/A | Cloud Service | ✅ Active | https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/devq-ai/pfinni |

#### Database Connections
| Database | Namespace | Database Name | Connection |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| SurrealDB Main | healthcare | patient_dashboard | ws://localhost:8000/rpc |
| SurrealDB Cache | cache | patient_dashboard_cache | ws://localhost:8080/rpc |
| SurrealDB Jobs | jobs | patient_dashboard_jobs | ws://localhost:8080/rpc |

#### External Services
| Service | URL | Purpose | Status |
|---------|-----|---------|--------|
| Resend | smtp.resend.com:587 | Email notifications | ✅ Configured |
| Insurance API | secure-eligibility.insurance-hub.com | Insurance verification | 🟡 Not Implemented |

#### Environment Variables
- Main config: `/Users/dionedge/devqai/pfinni/.env`
- Backend loads via `pydantic_settings` automatically
- Frontend requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side vars

#### Common Commands
```bash
# Check running services
ps aux | grep -E "(surreal|uvicorn|next)" | grep -v grep

# Backend logs
tail -f /tmp/backend.log

# Check port usage
lsof -i :8000  # SurrealDB
lsof -i :8001  # Backend
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend

# Start services (in order)
# 1. SurrealDB Main (✅ already running on port 8000)
# 2. SurrealDB Cache (✅ already running on port 8080)  
# 3. Backend (✅ already running): cd /Users/dionedge/devqai/pfinni/patient-dashboard/backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
# 4. Frontend (❌ not running): cd frontend && npm run dev

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Backend health check
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=admin@example.com&password=Admin123!" # Login test
```

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
- 1. DO NOT start backend on port 8000 - conflicts with SurrealDB
- 2. DO NOT expose secrets in code - use environment variables
- 3. DO NOT commit .env files to git
- 4. ALWAYS check this list before starting new services
